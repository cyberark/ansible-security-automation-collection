# cyberark_account

Allows for adding, deleting, modifying a privileged credential within the Cyberark Vault.  The request uses the Privileged Account Security Web Services SDK.<br>

The ability to modify consists of the following:

* Password (see secret_management)
* Safe
* Platform
* Address
* Object Name
* Username
* Platform Account Properties
  * These are the parameters listed in the Platform under `UI & Workflows -> Properties` and are unique to each Platform (see image below)
* Remote Machines Access

![Platform Account Properties](https://github.com/cyberark/ansible-security-automation-collection/blob/master/docs/images/platform_account_properties.JPG?raw=true)

### secret_management
The `secret_management` dictionary provides the capability to set a CPM password rotation flag on an existing account.

The available options are as follows:<br>

`automatic_management_enabled`: bool<br>
`manual_management_reason`: This is a string value that populates the Reason field is you have set an account to not be managed by the CPM.  This value is only necessary if `automatic_management_enabled` is set to false.<br>
`management_action`: This value indicates what type CPM management flag will be placed on the account
* change - <br>
* change_immediately - <br>
* reconcile - <br>

`new_secret`: This parameter is available to set the value of the new password<br>
`perform_secret_management`: This parameter was allows the option to place a CPM management flag on an account upon creation of an account object.
* always - All `secret_management` actions will follow the table below at all times.
* on_create - Will place a CPM management flag according to the table below ONLY on creation of an account object.

#### Secret Management Action Table
| management_action   | new_secret  | Action  |
| :---------: | :----: | :----- |
| change | populated | change password to set value at next scheduled rotation |
| change | NULL | rotate password at next scheduled rotation |
| change_immediately | populated | change immediately to the set value |
| change_immediately | NULL | rotate immediately |
| reconcile | populated | reconcile immediately NOT to set value |
| reconcile | NULL | reconcile immediately |
| NULL | populated | set value in Vault ONLY |


### identified_by
This property allows for the module to confidently identify the account object needing to be identified.  If multiple accounts are returned from the modules initial `Get Accounts` it will use the value(s) set in the `identified_by` parameter to direct which account is selected from the list.

**EXAMPLE:**
```
-Playbook Parameters-

cyberark_account:
  identified_by: "address,username,platform_id"
  safe: "testSafe"
  address: "dev.local"
  username: "admin"
  platform_id: WinDomain

  -This is the query sent to CyberArk Web SDK:
/api/Accounts?filter=safeName eq testSafe&search= admin dev.local

**This could return multiple accounts in the testSafe**

RETURNED:
account1
  username: administrator
  address: cyberark.dev.local
  safe: testSafe
  policyID: WinDomain

account2
  username: admin
  address: dev.local
  safe: testSafe
  policyID: WinDomain
```
With the `identified_by` parameter set the `cyberark_account` module will select the account2 object becauses the values of the `address`, `username` and `platform_id` parameters are identical matches to the values of account2 properties.

#### Limitations
**Idempotency** - All actions taken in the module adhere to the Ansible idempotency guidelines _except_ for password change.  If you have the playbook set to modify a password it will send a password change request every time the playbook is run, even if you are defining the next password value and it is the same password that is set in other runs.<br>
**Remote Machines Access** - When modifying the values in the `remote_machines_access` dictionary be mindful of the `platform_id` value.  Remote Machines Access values are stored at the Vault database level and not stored as File Categories.  It is a function that is only available with the `WinDomain` platform and if you attempt to assign these values to another platform it will cause errors in the PSM functionality.
