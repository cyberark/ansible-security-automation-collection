# cyberark_authentication


Authenticates to CyberArk Vault using Privileged Account Security Web Services SDK and creates a session fact that can be used by other modules. It returns an Ansible fact called `cyberark_session`. Every module can use this fact as `cyberark_session` parameter.

## Example Playbooks

**Shared Logon Authentication.**<br/>
Shared authentication is based on a user credential file that is stored in the PVWA web server. During shared authentication, only the user defined in the credential file can log on to the PVWA, but multiple users can use the logon token.

This type of authentication requires the playbook to manage the users as the Vault can't identify which specific user performs each action.

Multiple concurrent connections can be created using the same token, without affecting each other.

The shared user is defined in a user credential file, whose location is specified in the WSCredentialFile parameter, in the appsettings section of the PVWAweb.config file:

```xml
<add key="WSCredentialFile" value="C:\CyberArk\Password Vault Web Access\CredFiles\WSUser.ini"/>
```
> Make sure that this user can access the PVWA interface.<br/>
> Make sure the user only has the permissions in the Vault that they require.

It is recommended to secure connections between Ansible and the REST Web Services when using Shared Logon Authentication, using Client Authentication.

In addition to SSL, use Client Authentication to authenticate Ansible using a client certificate.

[Configuring client authentication via certificates](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/PAS/Latest/en/Content/SDK/Configuring%20Client%20Authentication%20via%20Client%20Certificates.htm)

```yaml
- name: Logon to CyberArk Vault using PAS Web Services SDK - use_shared_logon_authentication
  cyberark.pas.cyberark_authentication:
    api_base_url: "{{ web_services_base_url }}"
    use_shared_logon_authentication: true
```

**CyberArk Authentication**<br/>
This method authenticates a user to the Vault and returns a token that can be used in subsequent web services calls. In addition, this method allows you to set a new password.

Users can authenticate using **CyberArk**, **LDAP** or **RADIUS** authentication.

```yaml
- name: Logon to CyberArk Vault using PAS Web Services SDK - Not use_shared_logon_authentication
  cyberark.pas.cyberark_authentication:
    api_base_url: "{{ web_services_base_url }}"
    username: "{{ password_object.password }}"
    password: "{{ password_object.passprops.username }}"
    use_shared_logon_authentication: false
```
**Logoff**<br/>
This method logs off the user and removes the Vault session.

```yaml
- name: Logoff from CyberArk Vault
  cyberark.pas.cyberark_authentication:
    state: absent
    cyberark_session: "{{ cyberark_session }}
```
